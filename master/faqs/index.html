      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p>
        <h3 id="01">Q: How much does your service cost?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> We offer a variety of background check options from <a href="products-and-services.html" target="_blank">discounted pre-set packages</a> to <a href="products-and-services-custom.html" target="_blank">fully customizable screening
          solutions</a>. Our packages range from $29.95 up to $99.95 per applicant. Select a package and add reports that are relevant to the position for which you are hiring, or create your own Custom Background Check with all the searches you
        need. Prices for Custom Background Checks vary based on the searches you include.
        <br /><br />
        A one-time setup fee of $100 is required to establish an account with Backgrounds Online. However, this fee is waived if you order a minimum of $49.95 within 30 days of setting up your account. Contact our <a href="contact-sales.html" target="_blank">experienced
          staff</a> for help with creating a custom report or for exact quotes based on the searches you wish to run.

      </p>




      <p>
        <h3 id="03">Q: How quickly can I get started?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> You can <a href="CreateAccount/index.html" target="_blank">create your own account online</a> and request background checks immediately or <a href="contact-us.html" target="_blank">contact us</a> for assistance. We'll get your
        account setup and ready to go within a few business hours. Please note: background checks will not be processed until an account is approved.
        <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="04">Q: Can I create a screening account online?</h3>

        background checks immediately. We will need to review and verify your account (that typically takes about 2 business hours). <a href="CreateAccount/index.html" target="_blank">Create your account and start screening today</a>.

      <p>
        <h3 id="06">Q: I am a Notary. Should I start my own screening account?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> We provide screening services for Notaries, but they are conducted via third-party employers. If an agency is interested in hiring you or it's time for an annual background check, they will contact us and schedule the background
        screening. Notaries do not need to start their own screening accounts.
        <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>

      <h2>My Account</h2>

      <p>
        <h3 id="07">Q: What information do I need from an applicant to run a background check?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> You will need the candidate's full legal name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, home address and phone number. Some searches and verifications require additional information.
        <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="08">Q: Can my applicant submit their own information for a background check?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Yes, Backgrounds Online offers an Applicant Self-Submittal service. You provide the applicant's name and email address and we'll send them all the information they need to get started. This saves you time and reduces the risk of
        errors during the data input process.
        <br /><br />
        When you order a background check, you will have the option to provide the applicant's information yourself or you can ask them to submit it directly to us. Our Applicant Self-Submittal feature can save you time and help reduce the
        possibility of manual data entry errors.
        <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>

        <h3 id="12">Q: Do you invoice your clients?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Yes. We send invoices on the first of the month for the previous months' balance. They can be sent via standard mail or email. We send follow-up invoices when a bill is 30 days past due. You can review your invoices at any time by

      <p>
        <h3 id="13">Q: How do I submit a background check?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> After your applicant or employee signs the disclosure and release forms, you can <a href="https://clients.backgroundsonline.com/login.aspx" target="_blank">login</a> to your Backgrounds Online account and <a href="https://clients.backgroundsonline.com/Ordering.aspx"
          target="_blank">order a report</a>. You'll have the option to provide the candidate's information or take advantage of our Applicant Self-Submittal feature that empowers the individual to submit their information directly to us.

      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="14">Q: What paperwork do I need to perform a background check?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Before we can run a background check on your behalf, you must have your applicant or employee sign a disclosure and release form. We provide this documentation when your account is created and it is available at any time within
        your <a href="https://clients.backgroundsonline.com/ReleaseForms.aspx" target="_blank">Resource Center</a>.
        <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="15">Q: Do you provide all the documents I need for the screening process?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Yes. We provide the Release Forms you need to request a background check as well as Pre-Adverse and Adverse letters and a Summary of Rights granted by the FCRA. These documents are all available within your <a href="https://clients.backgroundsonline.com/ReleaseForms.aspx"
          target="_blank">Resource Center</a>.

      <p>
        <h3 id="16">Q: How quickly will I get results?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Most of our background checks are completed within three to five business days. Now and then there may be a delay that causes a report to take longer than our average turnaround time. If this happens, we will inform you of the
        delay, let you know why and provide updates on when the report will be complete.

        <b>A:</b> We'll send you an email when a background check is complete so you'll know it's available and ready to review. You can also <a href="https://clients.backgroundsonline.com/login.aspx" target="_blank">login</a> to your account at any

      <p>
        <h3 id="18">Q: What causes a background check to be delayed?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Delays can occur for various reasons:
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Reports are most often delayed due to issues with clerk assisted searches. This can happen if court clerks are unavailable for a day or more or if they have a backlog of work. </li>
          <li>Delays also occur when a court has issues with their electronic system and clerks are unable to look up specific records. </li>
          <li>Harsh weather can lead to unexpected court closures, which can cause delays. </li>
          <li>Reports might also be delayed if it takes longer than expected to make contact with a professional reference or previous employer. </li>
        </ul>
        After you order a report, you can check the status at any time using your <a href="https://clients.backgroundsonline.com/ReportManager.aspx" target="_blank">Report Manager</a>.

        <h3 id="20">Q: What information do you provide in your reports?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> We offer screening packages that include the most commonly used searches. You can also customize a background check to include all the searches you want for a specific position. A background check can provide:
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Identity verification (Social Security Number Trace)</li>
          <li>Criminal records</li>
          <li>Motor vehicle records</li>

          <li>Other useful data</li>
        </ul>


        In some cases, the amount of data in a report will be determined by local and state laws. Backgrounds Online always provides the most complete and accurate information that is legally reportable.

      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="21">Q: Is there information I cannot get from a background check?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Yes, some data is not permitted in a background check. This includes criminal records that have been expunged, convictions that occurred while the individual was a minor and credit scores. Laws that stipulate what information is
        reportable vary by jurisdiction. If you have questions about the availability of information in a specific area, please <a href="contact-us.html">contact us</a> for assistance.

      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="22">Q: What if I just want a single report, not a complete background check?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Backgrounds Online offers individual reports. While logged in to your account, click the <a href="https://clients.backgroundsonline.com/Ordering.aspx">Order Reports</a> link and you'll see the option to run a single report.

      <p>
        <h3 id="23">Q: Do you have a list of all the searches you offer?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Yes, you can see all of our preset packages and individual reports on our <a href="products-and-services.html">Products page</a>.
        <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="24">Q: Are criminal results obtained directly from the courts?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Yes. When you run a <a href="products-and-services/criminal-searches/county-court-search.html">County Criminal Court Search</a> the records are pulled directly from the courthouse. This gives you the most accurate, reliable and
        current information. We also offer statewide and nationwide searches to cover a larger area. If we find records during a nationwide search, then a county search is required. This is done to ensure your report includes the most up-to-date and
        accurate information.
        <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>
      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="25">Q: What do I do if you find a criminal record?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> If an applicant or employee has a criminal record, you will simply need to review the details and determine how to proceed. Should you decide not to hire an applicant due to a criminal record, then you must first provide them with
        a Pre-Adverse Action Letter and a copy of the Summary of Rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The applicant must be allowed time to review the results of their report and dispute them if necessary. Assuming there is no dispute,
        the next step is to provide an Adverse Action Letter with another copy of the Summary of Rights. Backgrounds Online provides all of these forms at no charge to our clients.

      </p>


      <p>
        <h3 id="26">Q: Do you offer Social Security Number Traces Online?</h3>
        <b>A:</b> Yes. Once you start an account with Backgrounds Online you can run a Social Security Number Trace as a standalone request. This search is also included with every background check package.

        <h2>Security and Compliance</h2>

        <p>
          <h3 id="27">Q: Does the applicant need to give his/her consent?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> Yes, applicants must sign a disclosure and release form before you can run a background check on them. Backgrounds Online provides legally compliant release forms at no charge.
          <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>

          <b>A:</b> Yes, your information is secure. We place a high priority on data <a href="technology.html">security and encryption</a>. When you login to our website you are protected via 128-bit SSL certification. To help demonstrate our
          commitment to security, Backgrounds Online voluntarily underwent a Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 audit. Our SOC 2 report contained no exceptions, which shows that we meet the security standards established by the American Institute
          of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

        <p>
          <h3 id="29">Q: Do you have a SOC 2 report?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> Yes, Backgrounds Online voluntarily underwent a 6-month audit from a third party CPA. This audit tested the security controls we have in place as well as the operating effectiveness of those controls. Our audit confirmed that we
          meet the criteria for the Trust Services Principles of Security and Confidentiality that were established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

          <h3 id="30">Q: Are your services FCRA compliant?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> Yes, our background checks contain reportable data that is in compliance with FCRA regulations. All of our background screening professionals have earned their FCRA certification and we make a point of keeping up with federal and

        <p>
          <h3 id="31">Q: Is Backgrounds Online NAPBS Accredited?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> Yes, Backgrounds Online is among the few employment screening firms to be accredited by the National Association of Professional Background Screeners. This shows that we uphold the highest standards of:

          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Consumer Protection</li>
            <li>Compliance</li>
            <li>Business Practices</li>

        </p>


        <p>
          <h3 id="32">Q: Can I run background checks after I hire an employee?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> Yes, but you must first obtain written authorization from the employee. It is a common practice to run background checks on employees who are being considered for a promotion or a change of position. Some companies run annual
          background checks on their employees. This shows the employer if a person incurs something new on their record such as a criminal conviction or civil judgment. Annual reports are often part of an employee safety and security plan.
          <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>
        </p>


        <p>
          <h3 id="33">Q: How do I know if an employee gets a new criminal record?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> Backgrounds Online offers ongoing Criminal Monitoring services. This is an easy, FCRA-compliant way to continually protect your business and make sure your staff remains eligible for employment. We monitor your employees to see
          if anyone incurs a new misdemeanor, felony or other conviction. If we find a new record, we'll let you know immediately so you can make informed business decisions. To get started, <a href="https://clients.backgroundsonline.com/login.aspx">login
            and contact your Account Manager</a>.

        </p>


        <p>
          <h3 id="34">Q: What does Ban the Box mean for my business?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> The Ban the Box movement calls for the removal of any question about criminal records from job applications. This is done to give people with minor or irrelevant records a chance to obtain employment. Employers who see that an
          applicant has checked the box, indicating they have been convicted of a crime, may be likely to reject the candidate without reviewing details about the case or other relevant information.
          <br /><br />
          Many locations have adopted Ban the Box policies, thus making it illegal to ask about criminal records on applications in those areas. More cities, counties and states are likely to implement similar laws.
          <br /><br />
          It is illegal to ask about criminal convictions on job applications in areas where the Ban the Box laws have been implemented. This can impact both local and national employers. National companies may have a single application that they
          use everywhere. However, if that application asks the applicant to check a box if they have a criminal conviction, then use of that form will likely be illegal in certain areas where the company is hiring.

        <h2>Applicants</h2>

        <p>
          <h3 id="35">Q: How do I provide consent for a background check?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> If a business or organization requests a background check on you, then we will send you an email that asks you to consent to the background screening. If you do not consent, then no further action is required. We will not begin a
          background investigation until you provide consent.
          To provide consent, click the link in the email we send you. It leads to a secure, private flow that is only accessible to you. Go through each page, provide the requested information and agree to the screening. We will start your
          background check as soon as it is authorized by you.
          <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>
        </p>


        <p>
          <h3 id="36">Q: How long does it take to complete a background check?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> Most background checks take 3 – 5 business days to complete.
          <br /><br />
          When we run a background check, we go directly to county courthouses to get the most current and accurate records. Some courts have a backlog of requests or a limited number of clerks to look up the information we need. These factors can
          cause delays in the screening process.
          <br /><a href="#00">[back to top]</a>
        </p>


        <p>
          <h3 id="37">Q: Can an employer decide not to hire me based on my background check?</h3>
          <b>A:</b> Yes, but first they must inform you of that possibility. They will send you a Pre-Adverse notification that lets you know that they are considering denial of employment. You will also receive a copy of your rights under the Fair
          Credit Reporting Act and a copy of your background check.
          <br /><br />
          You will have a reasonable amount of time to review your report. If you believe the information in your report is incorrect, you may <a href="dispute-results.html">file a dispute</a>.
          <br /><br />
          A final hiring decision cannot be made until the dispute is resolved.
