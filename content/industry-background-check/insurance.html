              <h2>Insurance Companies Face Hiring Issues</h2>
              The insurance industry is constantly in need of people. It can be difficult to find personnel for all your staffing needs. That makes it even more important to employ eligible, reliable candidates. If you skip the background screening
              process, you may hire someone who is not qualified to represent your company and end up terminating their employment. This leads to yet another time-consuming hiring phase. Reduce the hiring issues you already face by properly
              screening people before extending offers.

              <h2>Credential Verifications For The Insurance Industry</h2>
              When a customer calls their insurance agent, they've probably endured a difficult or painful experience. Insurance professionals work with people who were involved in accidents, victimized by criminals or subjected to personal loss.
              Your customers count on their representatives to be knowledgeable, credentialed individuals who can help during difficult times. We provide Credential Verification services that ensure your applicants are qualified for the job.

              <h2>Are You Taking Unnecessary Hiring Risks?</h2>
              Hiring someone without a background check can cause multiple issues. You could hire someone who is not qualified, does not have a necessary license or has a serious criminal record. Thoroughly screening candidates before making a final
              offer is paramount. Backgrounds Online confirms identities, verifies education, licenses and employment, and notifies you of reportable criminal records. You can also request a Employment Credit Report for relevant positions, in order
              to learn about the applicant's financial history.

          <h2>FCRA Compliant Screening For The Insurance Industry</h2>
          Your office may have urgent hiring needs. You might be inclined to rush the background screening process and make faster hiring decisions. But if you take shortcuts, like using an applicant's social profiles to decide whether or not to
          extend an offer, then you run the risk of breaking FCRA regulations.
          <br /><br />
          It is essential to only utilize FCRA compliant screening methods for hiring purposes. Backgrounds Online has many years of experience. We are FCRA certified and we do everything possible to stay educated on current and new regulations.
          Don't take risks during your hiring process. Partner with us for authoritative, expeditious and fully compliant background screening services.

              <div class="a_2 sbi_faq_answer" style="display: none;">
                <b>A:</b> We recommend background checks for every employee. There are several reasons for this.
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>Fairness. You cannot show favoritism in the hiring process. The best way to be fair is to screen every employee equally. Backgrounds Online helps you create screening packages that are tailored to each job type. You can save
                    those packages and use them again for future hires.</li>
                  <li>Compliance. There are numerous FCRA and state regulations that must be followed throughout the hiring process. One of the most important involves obtaining background information from a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA). It is
                    not legal to obtain background information via Google searches or social media.</li>
                  <li>Risk. If you do not follow regulations that govern the hiring process, you are breaking federal and/or state laws. The best way to avoid these risks is by obtaining valid background checks for every potential employee from a
                    CRA.</li>
