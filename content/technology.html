              Backgrounds Online provides an unsurpassable integration solution that syncs Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) with our internal web application. This allows our clients to request background checks while simultaneously providing the

              Due to the sensitive nature of the data we deal with, security is of the utmost importance. We use an encrypted SSL channel to ensure that the integration process results in a completely secure connection.
